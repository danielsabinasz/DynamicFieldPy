DynamicFieldPy is a high-level API that allows to define [neural dynamic architectures](https://www.dynamicfieldtheory.org) in a generic way, i.e., in a way that is  uncommitted as to the means by which the architecture is
simulated (e.g., on a CPU, a GPU, or neuromorphic hardware).

The recommended way to simulate such architectures is [DynamicFieldFlow](https://github.com/danielsabinasz/DynamicFieldFlow/). Check out the examples folder of DynamicFieldFlow to get started.
